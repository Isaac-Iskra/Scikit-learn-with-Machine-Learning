# Scikit-learn-with-Machine-Learning
Examples using SciKit-learn tools in Machine Learning 


The work done in this repository is from the book "Python: Machine Learning" by Wei-Meng Lee.  I do not own the legal rights to it.

In this repository, we see how to get started with the Scikit-learn library to solve a linear regression problem.  In addition, we also learned how to get sample datasets, generate your own, perform data cleansing, as well as the two techniques that you can use to remove outliers from your datasets - Turkey Fences and Z-scores
